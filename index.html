                <p> I am Sydnie McDonald I go by she/her pronouns. I attended The University of Alabama at Birmingham. I studied Computer Science with a minor in Medical Sociology.<br>
                I was introduced to Alchemy last November by my partner Joel. This is something I have been looking for to specifically develop my programming skills. <br>
                I look forward to creating amazing things here.
                I have been doing freelance work and I love creating beautiful websites for my clients. I am trying to expand my skills and services offered. 
                I used to teach young girls how to code and I received a grant to continue my course but then COVID happened.
                I recently created a course to teach others how to get started freelancing.

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p> I enjoy walking my dog and playing with her. Learning is a big hobby for me. I enjoy research and development so I spend a lot of outside time working on projects, searching for resources and cultivating new ideas.
                    <br> I love seeing all the information available and out there to find. I am trying to get more into reading.
                    I'm pretty good at cooking so I want to improve my cooking skills as well and make new foods.
